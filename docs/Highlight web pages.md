[[Introduction to Obsidian Web Clipper|Web Clipper]] allows you to highlight text on web pages, and select the elements you want to save to Obsidian. Your highlights are saved, so you can revisit them when you return to a page.

Highlights can be [[Capture web pages|captured]] and saved to Obsidian when you open the extension.

## Turn on highlighting

You can turn on highlighting in several ways, depending on your browser:

- The highlighter icon in the extension panel.
- Hotkeys, to activate the extension from your keyboard.
- Context menu, by right-clicking the web page you are visiting.

Once highlighting is on, you can select text, images, and elements you want to highlight.

## Highlighter settings

You can change the highlighter behavior by going to Web Clipper settings. Here you can also export your highlights to a `.json` file.
